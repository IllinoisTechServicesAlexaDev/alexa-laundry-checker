welcome: |
  Welcome to the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign residence hall laundry info skill. 
  Say "help" for more information on what I can do.
  
help: |
  My main function is to provide information on availability of laundry machines in all residence hall buildings. 
  For example, you can say, "general search", to get the current status of all laundry rooms. 
  For information on which buildings I know about, say "what buildings are supported?" 
  Or say, "interactive", and I will ask you questions to help narrow down your query.

general_search_answer: |
  The current status is.\n{% for item in info %}\n  {{ item.building }} room {{ item.room }} has {{ item.washers }} washers and {{ item.dryers }} dryers available.\n{% endfor %}

ask-building: |
  Which building's machines are you interested in now?

ask-machine: |
  Ok. Which type of machine in {{ building }} do you want to know about? Washers or Dryers?

answer-supported-building: |
  I have information for the laundry availability in these buildings.\n{% for item in results %}\n  {{ item }}.\n {% endfor %}

answer-entress: |
  Right now, {{ building }} {{ room }} has {{ numbers }} {{ machine }} available.

reprompt_general: |
  What other information would you like?

error-not-found: |
  I'm sorry, but I have no information about that right now. 
  You can ask another one question now, or  say "stop" or "cancel" to end this session.

error-not-understand: |
  I'm sorry, but I didn't understand that. Could you say it again?

error-other: |
  I'm sorry, but I experienced an error. Please ask me again.'

goodbye: Goodbye.
